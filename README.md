# Happy Thoughts

Project during Technigo web.dev. program to practice React state skills by fetching and posting data to an API.

Structure: 
App.jsx is root
Form.jsx and Createthought.jsx are children of App.jsx
LikeButton.jsx is child of Form.jsx

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

The command below will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```

### The Problem

Started out by sketching the components. Did change some of them as there wasn't that much of css. Team, Stack, course-material and chatGPT were used. ChatGPT helped me understand my code better as i turned to it to explain my code. That's also where some of the comments comes from.
